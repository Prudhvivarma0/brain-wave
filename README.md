# Brain-Wave Project üåê

This is the repository for the **Brain-Wave** project. This project leverages **Next.js** and **TypeScript** to build a high-performance web application, optimized for smooth functionality and an efficient user experience.
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
